Version 1.4.1   1)  Improved file properties-recognition
		2)  The not[value] parameter does work now with containers
		3)  Fixed bug where audio and subtitle-stream properties were not detected properly when no language
		    was specified in the stream
		3)  Fixed bug in logfile where only the first detected stream of each category was displayed
		4)  Audio channels are from now on processed solely as numbers
		5)  Due to the new parser, dts is now recognized as dca. Added automatic handling of dca and dts in config files.
		6)  PoisonConvert now has full command line integration. Every option in the settings can now be changed via command
		    line for a single session. Invoke PoisonConvert with "-h" or "--help" to get an overview.
		    Note: PoisonConvert direct conversion is now triggered with "-s" or "--start" so adjust your scheduler
		    accordingly. If you want to specify config files, use "-c" or "--config-files".
		7)  Synology: PoisonConvert will installed in /usr/syno/bin bin by default and the configuration files are
		    located in /usr/syno/etc/poisonconvert. There is also a installer script that automatically installs
		    a pre-compiled binary on your DiskStation which means that you don't have to compile it yourself anymore.
		    Therefore, you are not dependent on ipkg or any toolchain anymore.
		8)  Added settings to adjust the ffmpeg, ffprobe and qt-faststart command.
		9)  Logging is now disabled by default (leaving the option: log-path empty).
		10) Improved "destination" setting: Now you can leave this option empty and PoisonConvert does not move 
		    your files after successful conversion.

		    (this makes the "delete"-setting saver)
		    The success is determined by comparing the duration and streams.
		5)  Failed files are reverted automatically (they dor not get .old etc.
	 	    appended)
		6)  Added makefile installer
		7)  Removed some bad "system" calls
		8)  Added functionality to specify "-" for the container in order to analyze any file
